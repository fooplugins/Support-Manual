# FooPlugins Support Manual

This is the FooPlugins Support Manual. 

This is what we expect all our Support Technicians to know and do like the backs of their hands.

The purpose of this Manual is to provide support technicians with a guide which will help them excel in their day-to-day tasks. This isn't supposed to be a list of regulations or "rules" that are burdensome, but rather guidelines based on years of experience to empower success.

The original version of this manual was published publicly for anyone to reference or fork by  [https://impress.org/]()(https://impress.org/) 

You can fork a copy for yourself at  [https://github.com/impress-org/support-manual]()(https://github.com/impress-org/support-manual) 

We are extremely grateful to Impress for the incredible amount of thought and care that has gone into developing this manual and their support processes.
